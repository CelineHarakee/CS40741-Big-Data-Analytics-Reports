# CS40741-Big-Data-Analytics-Reports



Welcome to the **Lab Problems & Solutions Repository** for this course. This repository is designed to help students learn from each other by documenting:
* Issues faced during labs
* Error messages encountered
* Steps taken to solve them
* Final solutions and explanations

By sharing problems and fixes, we build a collaborative knowledge base that benefits everyone now and in future semesters.

## Purpose
During lab sessions, many students face similar challenges. Instead of solving them individually and forgetting the solution, this repository allows us to:
* Document common errors
* Share debugging strategies
* Understand root causes
* Learn best practices
* Improve problem-solving skills
