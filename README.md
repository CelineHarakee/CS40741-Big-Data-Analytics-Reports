# CS40741-Big-Data-Analytics-Reports



Welcome to the **Lab Problems & Solutions Repository** for this course. This repository is designed to help students learn from each other by documenting:
* Issues faced during labs
* Error messages encountered
* Steps taken to solve them
* Final solutions and explanations

By sharing problems and fixes, we build a collaborative knowledge base that benefits everyone now and in future semesters.

---

## Purpose
During lab sessions, many students face similar challenges. Instead of solving them individually and forgetting the solution, this repository allows us to:
* Document common errors
* Share debugging strategies
* Understand root causes
* Learn best practices
* Improve problem-solving skills

* Each lab has its own folder.
* Each problem has its own Markdown file.
* A template is provided to ensure consistency.

## How to Submit a Problem Report

1. Go to the correct **Lab folder**.
2. Copy the file from `Templates/problem_template.md`.
3. Rename it using the format:

```
LabNumber_ProblemShortTitle_YourName.md
```

Example:

```
Lab2_HadoopInstallation_Celine.md
```

4. Fill in all sections clearly.
5. Commit your changes (or submit a Pull Request if required).

## Problem Report Format

Each report should include:

* **Lab number**
* **Student name**
* **Date**
* **Problem description**
* **Steps taken**
* **Error messages**
* **Final solution**
* **Notes / Lessons learned**

Clear explanations are more valuable than short answers.

---

## Collaboration

Students are encouraged to:
* Read previous reports before asking questions.
* Improve unclear explanations.
* Suggest alternative solutions.
* Add comments for clarification.

Learning happens best when we share knowledge.
